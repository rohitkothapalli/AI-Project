# Bott, The Deep-Learning Chatbot

## About this Project
Ted is a multipurpose chatbot made using Python3, who can chat with you and help in performing daily tasks. It uses NLP and Deep-Learning to analyse the user's message, classify it into the a broader category and then reply with a suitable message or the required information. It is hosted using flask and is available on heroku at the link specified above. 

First, the user message is lemmatized and pre-processed, before passing it to the deep-learning model used, an Artificial Neural Network with Softmax, to specify the query category which achieves an accuracy of **over 98%**.

### AIM

To build a chatbot using Python to embed it in a website or application


### PROBLEM STATEMENT 

 Consumers need excellent service when they use an application or website. If they have a query they cannot find the answer to, they may lose interest in the app. So, if you are building a website or application, you must offer the best quality service to your users so you don’t lose them and impact your bottom line.


### SOLUTION

A chatbot is an application that can enable automatic conversation between bots (AI) and a human via text or speech like Alexa. It’s available 24/7 to help users with their queries, navigate them, personalize user experience, boost sales, and provide deeper insights into customer behavior and needs to help you shape your products and services.

For this AI project, you can use a simple version of a chatbot that you can find on many websites. Identify their basic structure to start building a similar one. Once you have finished a simple chatbot, you can move to advanced ones.

To create a chatbot, AI concepts like Natural Language Processing (NLP) are used to enable algorithms and computers to comprehend human interactions through various languages and process those data. It breaks down audio signals and human text and then analyzes and converts the data in a machine-understandable language. You will also require different pre-trained tools, packages, and speech recognition tools to create an intelligent and responsive chatbot


### APPLICATIONS

Chatbots are highly useful in the corporate sector for customer service, IT helpdesk, sales, marketing, and HR. Industries from eCommerce, Edtech, and real estate to finance and tourism use chatbots. Top brands like Amazon (Alexa), Spotify, Marriott International, Pizza Hut, Mastercard, and more leverage chatbots.
